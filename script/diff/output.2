\begin{old}
The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
\end{old}
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
\begin{old}
The Named is the mother of all things.
\end{old}
\begin{bf}
The named is the mother of all things.

\end{bf}
Therefore let there always be non-being,
  so we may see their subtlety,
And let there always be being,
  so we may see their outcome.
The two are the same,
But after they are produced,
\begin{old}
  they have different names.
\end{old}
\begin{bf}
  they have different names.
They both may be called deep and profound.
Deeper and more profound,
The door of all subtleties!
\end{bf}
